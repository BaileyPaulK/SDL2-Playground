# SDL2-Playground
want that simple joy i had programming my calculator growing up.

linux and windows compile
for linux just use your package manager to instal SDL2 (likely already installed)
not currently a script to compile, just "g++ main.cpp -o aname.out" (.out so it isn't uploded to repository)

windows install SDL2 then just run windowsMake.sh
if it doesn't work, check to make sure the librares are being properly pointed to (they are currently just in source/SDL2)
